# Voluma: Scientific visualization toolkit

This is my personal project for graduate course **Scientific Visualization and Application Development**, it enables user get a graceful visualization of DCM CT scan data(data parsing powered by [dcmtk](https://shader-slang.com/slang/gfx-user-guide/)). I explore capability of [slang-gfx](https://shader-slang.com/slang/gfx-user-guide/) in this experimental project, which greatly helps me get familiar with modern graphics pipeline.

You can also see this project as a minimal example of slang-gfx's functionality and pipeline construction. However, I was rushing deadline when writing it, magic numbers may appears everywhere and most code may not be the best practice.
